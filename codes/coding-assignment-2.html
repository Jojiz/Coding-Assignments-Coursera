                        <p> The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus). 
                            Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018.
                            Up from more than 19 billion in 2011.There are more chickens in the world than any other bird or domesticated fowl.
                            Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and, less commonly, as pets. 
                            Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4thâ€“2nd centuries BC).</p>

                        <h2 id= "p2"> Beef Cattle </h2>
                        <p> Beef cattle are cattle raised for meat production (as distinguished from dairy cattle, used for milk production). 
                            The meat of mature or almost mature cattle is mostly known as beef. 
                            In beef production there are three main stages: cow-calf operations, backgrounding, and feedlot operations. 
                            The production cycle of the animals start at cow-calf operations; this operation is designed specifically to breed cows for their offspring.</p>

                        <h2 id= "p3"> Domestic Pork</h2>
                        <p> The domestic pig (Sus scrofa domesticus or only Sus domesticus), often called swine, hog, or simply pig when there is no need to distinguish it from other pigs, 
                           is a large, domesticated, even-toed ungulate. 
                           It is variously considered a subspecies of the Eurasian boar or a distinct species. 
                            The domestic pig's head-plus-body length ranges from 0.9 to 1.8 m (35 to 71 in), and adult pigs typically weigh between 50 and 350 kg (110 and 770 lb), with well-fed individuals often exceeding this weight range.</p>
